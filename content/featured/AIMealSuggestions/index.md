Building off of the MVP that I developed in college, I'm on a mission to encourage less food waste. Leveraging the **power of AI**, this app helps you manage the ingredients you have on hand, generate meal suggestions, and create smart, optimized grocery lists to **maximize value**.

*Github witheld because this project is in development and has an anticipated revenue model.*
