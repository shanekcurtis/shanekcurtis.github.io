My most successful app to date, with over **200k+ downloads**. Available on the iOS App Store. This app teaches you how to **Lucid Dream**, a brain phenomena that allows you to consciously take control of your dreams. 

I'm currently working on **Lucidity 3.0**, which introduces cloud storage, analytics, and a full conversion from `UIKit` > `SwiftUI` with an all-new design.

*Github withheld because I make revenue from this app.*
